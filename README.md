FRONTEND
TEST PROJECT GUIDELINES












INTRODUCTION
We’re extremely excited that you are interested in joining our team. To find out whether you are a good match for our team we would like to do a test project with you. As this is a test project we are not going to pay you anything for it.

We have probably the most free company culture you’ve ever seen or heard of. Our company culture is also reflected in our recruiting processes. We generally give the opportunity to try to work with us to nearly everyone (we do only a very basic screening of candidates) so it’s only up to you to show us how good you are and convince us that we should keep working with you and turn you into a full member of STRV. Once you submit the test project you agree that it becomes a property of STRV and we can do anything we want with it.

First we would like to try this project with you to see what would full engagement of you at STRV look and feel like. We expect to have the test project back within a week to prove that you are the right fit with our team and willing to fight hard for the job. Also note that if you submit incomplete work it will disadvantage your position in comparison with other candidates.

INSTRUCTIONS
We want you to create a React.js app. You will find the specifications for the app below. Commit your source code to a private repository on Bitbucket. When you are done, invite webtestproject@strv.com to your repository. Make sure to also send us the link to your private Bitbucket repository and a link to your live online demo (you can deploy the app for example on Heroku) via the submission page, which you can find at the bottom of the email you received with this document.

SPECIFICATION
You will be developing a simple app called Eventio which allows registered users to sign up for and create events. The app has to contain 5 pages: Login, Events List, Event Detail, Create Event, User Profile. Also, there is an optional page - Sign Up. Treat this app as an MVP of a much larger project that could scale and grow one day.

Event List
After logging in, users should be redirected to a list of all events. Each event should have brief information about its capacity and a link to more detailed information about the event (Event Detail page) as well as a button to attend the event.

Each event on the list should include:
title
description
date
organizer
number of attendees / capacity
attend/unattend button\


Event Detail
The Event Detail page should include:  
title
description

Create Event
On this page users will be able to set the title of their event, select a date, setup capacity and write a description.

User Profile
On this page, users will be able to show a small profile about themselves and list of events that he or she is planning to attend.
API
Find API documentation right here: http://docs.strvtestprojectv2.apiary.io/. Within the email from your recruiter you will be able to find the API key. The key is unique for your use only.
DESIGN
Our design department has prepared a simple look of Eventio. It looks minimalistic, straightforward and is without any tricky parts. You can find all resources (Sketch file, Previews, Fonts) here: https://goo.gl/EwFsBc. Keep in mind that following graphic designs is very important as well as following all required functions offered by the API. The app should be fully responsive, so don’t forget to also check the designs for the mobile version.
LAST WORDS
We can’t wait to see your version of Eventio. While developing, keep in mind, you should follow the latest best practises of frontend development. We will rate your app in the following areas:
Project Structure / Setup / Environment

HTML quality
CSS quality
JavaScript quality
Functionality


Feel free to email your recruiter if you have any question regarding these guidelines, and we will get back to you as soon as possible. 

That’s it. GOOD LUCK!
